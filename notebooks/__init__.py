The notebooks folder consists of four Jupyter notebooks that together form a complete machine learning workflow.

1. Data_exploration.ipynb - Performs initial data analysis and visualization to understand data distributions and potential issues.
2. Data_cleaning.ipynb - Handles data preprocessing and cleaning operations.
3. Train_model.ipynb - Trains some machine learning models using the cleaned dataset.
4. Model_evaluation.ipynb - Loads the trained models and evaluates their performance on a test set using classification metrics and comparisons.

A shared `commons.py` module provides utility functions used across the notebooks to keep code modular and reusable.
